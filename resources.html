                    <p>Your brain doesn't know the difference between a vividly imagined reality and your current one. When you repeatedly speak an identity statement, you are creating new neural pathways. This is <strong>self-directed neuroplasticity</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Neuroplasticity: Your Brain is Rewireable</h3>
                    <!-- DETAILED TEXT RESTORED HERE -->
                    <p>Your brain is not fixed. Every thought and action creates and reinforces neural pathways. When you consistently speak a new thought, you are physically building a new "road" in your brain, making that thought easier to access in the future. This is how change happens on a biological level.</p>

                    <h3>The Habit Loop: Cue, Routine, Reward</h3>
                    <!-- DETAILED TEXT RESTORED HERE -->
                    <p>Habits are automated by a neurological loop. "Break It" works by giving you a new, powerful "Routine" (speaking an affirmation) to insert when you get a "Cue" (an urge), leading to a positive "Reward" (a sense of control). This consciously overwrites the old, destructive pathway.</p>

                    <h3>Embodied Cognition: The Power of Voice</h3>
                    <!-- DETAILED TEXT RESTORED HERE -->
                    <p>Thinking a thought is passive. Speaking it is an action. When you use your voice, you engage the motor cortex and auditory system. Hearing yourself say "I am confident" in your own voice provides a powerful feedback loop to your brain, making the statement more believable and emotionally resonant than a silent thought.</p>

                    <!-- DETAILED TEXT RESTORED HERE -->
                    <p>"Prime Me" is based on the proven psychological concept of priming. By exposing your brain to specific words and concepts (like "calm" or "focus") right before an event, you make those states more mentally accessible, increasing the likelihood that you will actually feel and act that way.</p>
